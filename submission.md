# Submission Instructions

You must submit two items for this project. Both are required for full credit. Read all details carefully.

## 1. GitHub Repository Submission

You must submit the **link to your public GitHub repository** in the Canvas text box for this assignment.

Your repository must include:
- `main.cpp`
- `tree.h`
- `README.md`
- `CMakeLists.txt`
- Your `story.txt` file (generated after your first run)
- All source files needed to compile and run your program

Make sure your repository is **public** so the instructor can access and grade it.

## 2. Developer Log (Dev Log)

You must also include a **Developer Log** in your repository. The file must be named:

```
developer_log.md
```

Your Developer Log must include:
- A dated entry every time you work on the assignment
- A description of what you worked on
- Any bugs, issues, or problems you encountered
- How you attempted to solve each issue
- A brief explanation of every commit you make
- A list of all files modified during each commit

Commit messages must also be descriptive, and the Developer Log must reflect the reasoning behind each commit.

## Summary

To earn full credit:
1. Submit the **public GitHub repository link** in the Canvas submission text box.
2. Include a complete **developer_log.md** inside your repository.

Failure to provide both will result in a deduction.

Make sure your repository builds and runs correctly before submitting.
